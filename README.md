# CHIP-8 Emulator

This is a CHIP-8 emulator that I am writing in C and SDL2.
This is my first emulation project, so feedback is welcome.


This is an ongoing project.

For sources that I used, check the docs folder

## Installation

To install this project, you can either:

1. Download the zip file (not available yet) and use the emulator.exe

2. Build from source
    - You will require SDL2 installed locally and acccess to GNU-make
    - To build from source, first download the entire repository
    - Then in the source folder, copy the SDL2 include and lib folders
    - Run the command
    ```
    make
    ```
    - You will then have a emulator.exe available in the folder
